                        <p> <br>
                        After a 20-year career in healthcare device technology in microenterprise start-ups, large-scale global healthcare organizations, mergers, acquistions, and business system integrations, I have been privileged to see and support exceptional integrations of interdisciplinary skillsets that have exploded into revolutionary medical breakthroughs.  However, businesses can also idle on all cylinders with silos of unparalleled talent--not a good thing!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My experience in medical product safety and cybersecurity risk management in regulated industries offers a significant opportunity to help develop network and coding consultants in the medical device security industry as secure software development professionals.  The urgency is real, the need is not yet completely fulfilled, and the demand is growing.  The landscape of medical companies, large and small, cannot be fully supported by existing resources alone.  I am motivated to build a team of associates to bring their coding and framework knowledge to the medical device industry.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>With training, tools, and experience in education, I seek to bring the medical device market to the network IT and coding professional.  Quality, Compliance, and Regulatory Science knowledge is dynamic but not as dynamic as technology and web-based capabilities.  It will not take long before your knowledge base is complimented with compliance acumen in medical device cybersecurity, electronic medical record (EMR) privacy, or embedded system encryption technologies.</p>
